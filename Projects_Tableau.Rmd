Natural Disasters such as storms, hurricanes, and flash floods claims thousands of lives of lives each year in the United States. I downloaded the Storm Events Data from the NOAA’s National National Weather Service (NWS) website and created a dashboard using Tableau software.

The date ranged from 20211 to 2020 and the data were downloaded in .csv format (10 .csv file total). The data was cleaned up/joined in R and Excel.
