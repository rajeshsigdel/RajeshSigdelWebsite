Natural Disasters such as storms, hurricanes, and flash floods claims thousands of lives of lives each year in the United States. I downloaded the Storm Events Data from the [NOAA's National National Weather Service (NWS) website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/) and created a dashboard using **Tableau** software. 


The date ranged from 20211 to 2020 and the data were downloaded in .csv format (10 .csv file total). The data was cleaned up/joined in R and Excel. 

[Check here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rajesh6683/viz/storms_dashboard/Dashboard2) to view the dashboard.
