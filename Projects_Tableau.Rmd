Tableau is my favorite tool when it comes to visualizing non-spatial data. I love its flexibility in giving actionable insights of the data. It also helps tp analyze the data rapidly which helps make business faster.

Natural Disasters such as storms, hurricanes, and flash floods claims thousands of lives of lives each year in the United States. I downloaded the Storm Events Data from the NOAA’s National National Weather Service (NWS) website and created a dashboard using Tableau software.

The date ranged from 20211 to 2020 and the data were downloaded in .csv format (10 .csv file total). The data was cleaned up/joined in R and Excel.
